{{TAKEAWAY}} Multi-Class Planned Design Recipe
1. Describe the Problem

> As a customer
> So that I can check if I want to order something
> I would like to see a list of dishes with prices.

> As a customer
> So that I can order the meal I want
> I would like to be able to select some number of several available dishes.

> As a customer
> So that I can verify that my order is correct
> I would like to see an itemised receipt with a grand total.

2. Design the Class System
Consider diagramming out the classes and their relationships. Take care to focus on the details you see as important, not everything. The diagram below uses asciiflow.com but you could also use excalidraw.com, draw.io, or miro.com

- See a list of dishes 
- Dishes with prices
- Select some number of dishes
- Get itemised receipt
- Sum total

Also design the interface of each class in more detail.

class PizzaMenu
  constructor
    # menu is a list of dishes
    # menu is an empty array  

  addItem(pizza) 
    # pizza is an instance of Pizza
    # Pizza gets added to the menu
    # Returns nothing
  
  getMenu
    # Returns a list of pizza objects
    # all is an array of hashes
    # all starts as an empty array
  
  selectPizza(name) 
    # name is a string
    # Returns pizza selected
    # if name = nil, prints error message

  print_receipt
     # print itemised receipt from pizza selected
     for the pizzas selected. 
     # return menu_listing for dishes selected from menu

  sum_total
     # find total from itemised receipt
     # remove £ from string and change to float
     # puts values in an array and sum
     # return total in format £x.xx

class Pizza
  constructor(name, price) 
  #name is a string, price is a string with £

  getName
    # Returns name

  getPrice
    # Returns price

  class MenuFormatter
    constructor(pizza) #instance of Pizza

  getMenuListing
    # returns name and price in the format of a string "name ... price"


3. Create Examples as Integration Tests
Create examples of the classes being used together in different situations and combinations that reflect the ways in which the system will be used.

# EXAMPLE

# Shows all pizzas
pizza_menu = PizzaMenu.new
pizza_1 = Pizza.new("Four Cheese", "£8")
pizza_2 = Pizza.new("Margarita", "£7.50")
pizza_3 = Pizza.new("Vesuvius", "£9")
pizza_menu.add(pizza_1)
pizza_menu.add(pizza_2)
pizza_menu.add(pizza_3)
pizza_menu.getMenu # => [pizza_1, pizza_2, pizza_3]

# Selects a pizza from the menu
pizza_menu = PizzaMenu.new
pizza_1 = Pizza.new("Four Cheese", "£8")
pizza_2 = Pizza.new("Margarita", "£7.50")
pizza_3 = Pizza.new("Vesuvius", "£9")
pizza_menu.add(pizza_1)
pizza_menu.add(pizza_2)
pizza_menu.add(pizza_3)
pizza_menu.selectPizza("Margarita") # => pizza_2

# if no pizza selected
pizza_menu = PizzaMenu.new
pizza_1 = Pizza.new("Four Cheese", "£8")
pizza_2 = Pizza.new("Margarita", "£7.50")
pizza_3 = Pizza.new("Vesuvius", "£9")
pizza_menu.add(pizza_1)
pizza_menu.add(pizza_2)
pizza_menu.add(pizza_3)
menu.select("") # => "No pizza selected"

# Returns itemised receipt
pizza_menu = PizzaMenu.new
pizza_1 = Pizza.new("Four Cheese", "£8")
pizza_2 = Pizza.new("Margarita", "£7.50")
pizza_3 = Pizza.new("Vesuvius", "£9")
pizza_menu.add(pizza_1)
pizza_menu.add(pizza_2)
pizza_menu.add(pizza_3)
pizza_menu.select("Margarita")
pizza_menu.select("Four_Cheese")
pizza_menu.print_receipt # => "Margarita ... £7.50", "Four Cheese ... £8"

# Returns itemised receipt with multiple of same pizza
pizza_menu = PizzaMenu.new
pizza_1 = Pizza.new("Four Cheese", "£8")
pizza_2 = Pizza.new("Margarita", "£7.50")
pizza_3 = Pizza.new("Vesuvius", "£9")
pizza_menu.add(pizza_1)
pizza_menu.add(pizza_2)
pizza_menu.add(pizza_3)
pizza_menu.select("Margarita")
pizza_menu.select("Four_Cheese")
pizza_menu.select("Margarita")
pizza_menu.print_receipt # => "Margarita ... £7.50", "Four Cheese ... £8, "Margarita ... £7.50"

# Returns itemised receipt and sum total
pizza_menu = PizzaMenu.new
pizza_1 = Pizza.new("Four Cheese", "£8")
pizza_2 = Pizza.new("Margarita", "£7.50")
pizza_3 = Pizza.new("Vesuvius", "£9")
pizza_menu.add(pizza_1)
pizza_menu.add(pizza_2)
pizza_menu.add(pizza_3)
pizza_menu.select("Margarita")
pizza_menu.select("Four_Cheese")
pizza_menu.print_receipt # => "Margarita ... £7.50", "Four Cheese ... £8"
pizza_menu.sum_total # => # = "£15.50"

4. Create Examples as Unit Tests
Create examples, where appropriate, of the behaviour of each relevant class at a more granular level of detail.

# EXAMPLE

# PizzaMenu
# Initializes with an empty array
pizza_menu = PizzaMenu.new
pizza_menu.all # => []

# Pizza
# Constructs a pizza
pizza = Pizza.new("Margarita", "£7.50")
Pizza.name # => "Margarita"

# Prints menu listing
pizza = Pizza.new("Margarita", "£7.50")
Pizza.menu_listing # => "Margarita ... £7.50"


Encode each example as a test. You can add to the above list as you go.


5. Implement the Behaviour
After each test you write, follow the test-driving process of red, green, refactor to implement the behaviour.
